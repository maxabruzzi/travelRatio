# travelRatio
A R notebook to compute travel ratio using ChIP-seq signal track.

This notebook is NOT intended to be run as it is in your setting. And it has remained largely not parameterized yet. One would have to read the comments in detail to make changes accordingly (include file names, path of executables, etc) in order to run it.
